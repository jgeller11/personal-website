            <b>10. Adam Kirsch</b>

                    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">

            Some people wouldn’t touch Le’Veon Bell until late into the second round. Others, like Adam, will take him 5th overall. Even though he was debatably the best running back in football when he played two years ago, too much has changed for me to ever trust Bell at the 5th pick. After him, the team only gets riskier, with a constantly injured Devonta Freeman, to the legally conflicted Tyreek Hill. By stacking the Falcons, Adam needs to hope Atlanta returns to the high powered offense they had when they went to the Super Bowl, or else Adam will find himself as the Sykes by the end of the season.

                    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">

            Best Pick: Stefon Diggs

                    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">

            Worst Pick: Devonta Freeman
        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>9. Oliver Otto</b>
                    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">

            If you are a Mixon believer, then this team is probably pretty good. I’m not. And Phillip Lindsay, George Kittle, and Robert Woods are all going to regress. Maybe if Julio Jones messes around and goes for 3K, he can carry the whole team to a winning record. Oliver does have a solid bench, and Carson Wentz will be better than last year, but overall I don’t see this team being able to muster the points to make the playoffs.
                    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">

            Best Pick: Julio Jones
                    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">

            Worst Pick: George Kittle
        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>8. Julian Gideon</b>
                    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">

            I really don’t think he will finish this low, but with how his team currently is, he deserves to be ranked here. Todd Gurley could be a top 5 overall player and Michael Thomas is 100% going to get over 100 catches and at least 1200 yards like he has done in the past, but where is Julian Edelman’s upside? And will Marlon Mack really be that good? And will Sony Michel be any more consistent? And what if Gurley’s arthritis is as bad as it sounds? With the current players on his team, it is going to be hard rack up enough wins during the regular season.
                    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">

            Best Pick: Jared Cook
                    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">

            Worst Pick: Tom Brady
        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>7. Jon Geller</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Say what you want about Jon’s draft bot, but he wasn’t completely screwed over. Stacking Patrick Mahomes, Damien WIlliams, and Travis Kelce will be scary to go up against, and if Zeke doesn’t hold out, Jon will be able to put up big numbers week in and out. But, he still has abysmal wide receivers and an atrocious bench that he might not be able to overcome. Considering he didn’t have enough time to draft himself, it is unknown whether or not he will be on the waivers, or if he will even set his lineup consistently. If he puts full effort in, and maybe find value in a wide receiver, Jon could prove well in his first year in the league. But all signs point to a low finish.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Best Pick: Dalvin Cook (traded for Damien Williams and others)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Worst Pick: Golden Tate
        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>6. Pablo Santos</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Deandre Hopkins, James Conner, and Adam Thielen are about the safest three players you can have. It’s unlikely any of them will differ from their projection by much. If Chris Carson doesn’t lose his role to Penny, he could get a ton of yards. There’s nothing really about this team that makes me love it or hate it, so it gets put right in the middle. I would be both surprised if Pablo got Sykes or if he won it all with the mediocrity of this team.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Best Pick: Chris Carson</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Worst Pick: Baker Mayfield (too early)
        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>5. Jonny Haber</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            You might find it surprising that I have Jonny in the top half of the league this year, but his team is really not bad at all. With easily the best receiving corps containing Davante Adams, Juju, and Amari Cooper, Jonny is bound to succeed from catches, yards, and TDs. Now of course, using your first three picks on wide receivers means your running backs must be terrible… but they really aren’t! James White won’t produce top 8 stats like he did last year with the Patriots, but he is still a PPR gem, and nobody would be shocked if Leonard Fournette had 1200 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns with the run heavy Jaguars. Jonny doesn’t really have a chance to win the championship, but the fantasy playoffs should be in reach.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Best Pick: Juju Smith-Schuster</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Worst Pick: Lamar Miller
        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>4. Max Weil</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            It all depends on Melvin Gordon. Gordon could be traded to the Colts and then both him and Austin Ekeler are top 10 backs, or Melvin Gordon could hold out into the season, and Ekeler shows he can’t support a heavy workload. Kamara is obviously going to be good and Max hopes Josh Jacobs continues the trend of breakout rookie running backs. His receivers aren’t ideal with T.Y. Hilton, who can be inconsistant, Boyd, who isn’t on a great offense, and Cooper Kupp, who is coming off a bad knee injury. Max should be able to figure out his team by the time playoffs come around and for all we know, he could win the whole league with ease if just a few things go his way.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Best Pick: Melvin Gordon</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Worst Pick: Melvin Gordon
        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>3. Eric Markstein</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            With no injuries, Eric’s running backs should all succeed. With the upgrade from Eli Manning to Baker Mayfield, OBJ could go crazy this year, and his WR 2 will usually be Chris Godwin, but any of Godwin, DJ Moore, Christian Kirk, and Anthony Miller can fill the spot. With extremely reliable quarterbacks, Eric’s team is pretty well rounded. There might not be any players that will breakout and blow away expectations, but he doesn’t need anyone to for his team to still be a safe bet to make the playoffs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Best Pick: Aaron Jones</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Worst Pick: Waiting on a TE
        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>2. Ben Slaughter</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Maybe it was because Ben wasn’t present at the draft, and he only FaceTimed in for his own picks, but Ben’s team is probably the least acknowledged team in the whole league. With the number one pick, Slaughter took the best player in football in Saquon, then went with back to back safe wide receivers in Evans and Allen. Then he snagged the potential workhorse Kerryon Johnson, as well as the touchdown machine Derrick Henry. He has two solid tight ends, and his quarterback Jared Goff constantly is underrated. His starting lineup is the best in the league.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Best Pick: Kerryon Johnson</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Worst Pick: Jarvis Landry
        </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>1. Daniel Albert</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
            I think there is a player that isn’t talked about much when discussing Daniel’s team. And it's freaking Christian McCaffrey. We all know about his great running backs like Nick Chubb, Mark Ingram, David Montgomery and Miles Sanders, as well as his stud wide receivers like Antonio Brown, Brandin Cooks and Tyler Lockett, but CMC was the 3rd overall pick for a reason. Besides his weak TE and unproven quarterback, this team is absolutely stacked, and should easily find its way into the playoffs, and probably has the best chance of being this year’s Acadia.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Best Pick: Tyler Lockett
