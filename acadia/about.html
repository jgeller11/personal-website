            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Jonathan is new to the league this year, taking the place of Alex Ostrow (though he did serve as commissioner last season, much to the distaste of Daniel Albert). He could not attend the draft this year, so he sent a bot in his place to pick his team. He has never played fantasty before, and is aiming for ninth place. He is also the designer of this website, and manually updates it to post new blog posts and podcast episodes, since he apparently wasn't busy enough with college applications.

                Max Weil, pioneer of the Acadia Chasersüèà multimedia conglomerate, co-host of the Kenny and Berty Podcast, resident Bidyslexual, and 2017 league champion, comes into the season trying to keep his streak of making the playoffs every year.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Julian has been around as long as Acadia Chasers has. He loves to make bold predictions that either take him very far, or guarantee him a low finish. While he has made the playoffs a few times, he is looking to secure his first chip.
